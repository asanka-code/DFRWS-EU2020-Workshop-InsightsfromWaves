# DFRWS EU2020 Workshop - Insights from Waves

This repository contains the materials that will be used at the **Insights from Waves** workshop of DFRWS EU 2020. The participants need to attend with a computer configured with our virtual machine. The virtual machine is configured with all the required software environments and tools. You can setup your virtual machine by taking the following steps.

## Setting up a computer for the workshop

0. You need a host computer where you can dedicate at least 4GB of RAM and 20GB of disk space for a virtual machine.

1. Install **Oracle VirtualBox** and **VirtualBox Extension Pack** on your host computer. The version of the virtual box and extension pack has to match. Use the latest version to be sure that everything works perfectly. We've tested on version 6.1.8. Link: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

2. Download the **EMvidenceVM.ova** file from the following link and import it on VirtualBox. The downloadable file is about 3.7GB large. When importered into VirtualBox, it will take upto a maximum of 20GB disk space. Most probably, it will be less than that.

3. Start the VM and login at the bash prompt with username **emvidence** and password **emvidence**. Once logged-in, the graphical desktop environment will start up.

4. We need to get the latest workshop materials that will be downloaded with the help of a shell script. On the Desktop, you can find the shell script called **update-workshop-materials.sh**. Open a terminal at the Desktop and type the following command to run that shell script. It will download the latest version of workshop materials from this Github repository to the desktop.

     ```./update-workshop-materials.sh```

Now you are good to go! If you have any queries about the above steps, please feel free to contact me through the following email address: asanka[dot]sayakkara[at]ucdconnect[dot]ie.

## Trouble Shooting:
- If you are on a Mac and has an issue with the resolution of the VM, goto the VM settings and set the Graphics Controller to "VMSVGA".
